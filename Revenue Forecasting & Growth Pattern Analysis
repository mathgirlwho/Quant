### Executive Summary: Revenue Analysis & Forecasting

**Data Analysis:**
- **Revenue Growth Trends:**
  - **YoY Growth Calculation**: Calculated YoY growth rates for all companies from 2020 to present.
  - **Top 10 Companies with Highest YoY Growth**: Identified companies with the highest YoY growth in the latest quarter, with examples like Bajaj Holdings & Investment Ltd. (1297.9%) and Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Ltd. (1232.1%).
  - **Bottom 10 Companies with Lowest YoY Growth**: Identified companies experiencing consistent revenue decline, such as MMTC Ltd. (-99.9%) and Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. (-94.4%).
  - **Consistent Decline**: Companies with 4+ consecutive quarters of revenue decline were flagged for further analysis.

- **CAGR Calculation**: 
  - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for each company calculated to measure long-term growth trends.

- **Cluster Analysis**:
  - **Revenue Growth Pattern Clustering**: Applied k-means clustering to group companies based on similar revenue growth patterns and applied further subclustering.
  - **Feature Addition for Clustering**: Added relevant features like QoQ growth rate, Revenue Slope, Max Drawdown, and Rolling Average Growth for improved cluster separation.

**Predictive Modeling:**
- **Linear Regression for Revenue Forecasting**:
  - Trained a Linear Regression model to forecast the next quarter’s revenue (202403) for each company.
  - Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Forecast results for select companies compared against actual revenues.
  - Generated predictions for 500 companies and stored them for further analysis.
- **ARIMA Model**:
  - **ARIMA Forecasting**: Applied ARIMA model (ARIMA(1,1,1)) to predict revenue for individual companies and clusters.
  - **Company-Level Forecasting**: Used historical revenue series for individual companies to fit ARIMA models, forecasting future revenue for select companies.
  - **Cluster-Level Forecasting**: Aggregated revenue data by cluster and fitted ARIMA models for each cluster to forecast future performance.
  - **Plotting**: Displayed forecasted revenue alongside historical revenue to visualize trends and predictions.

- **LSTM Model**:
  - **Data Preparation for LSTM**: Scaled the revenue data using MinMaxScaler and reshaped it to fit LSTM model input.
  - **LSTM Training**: Defined and trained an LSTM model using past revenue data to predict next quarter's revenue.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Split data into training and testing sets, trained the model, and used it to predict future revenue.
  - **Prediction**: Forecasted the next quarter’s revenue based on historical growth metrics using LSTM for improved time-series predictions.

**Visualization:**
- **Predicted vs. Actual Revenue Comparison**: Plotted the predicted revenues vs actual revenues for top 10 performers and lowest 10 performers.
- **Seasonal and Sector-wide Trends**: Heatmaps and charts to analyze seasonal trends across different sectors.
- **Top and Bottom Performers**: Plots showing the comparison of predicted and actual revenue for companies with the highest and lowest YoY growth.

**Key Insights:**
- **High Growth Companies**: Some companies have shown exceptional growth (e.g., Bajaj Holdings & Investment Ltd.) indicating potential investment opportunities.
- **Underperforming Companies**: Companies with declining revenues, such as MMTC Ltd., require a strategic review for turnaround or divestment.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: The regression model’s predictions align reasonably well with actual revenues, providing a reliable forecasting tool for future decision-making.

**Next Steps:**
- **Model Improvement**: Explore more sophisticated models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for better accuracy, but since only simple models were asked, I've used the basic linear regression and then, one model from each category: statistical (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM).
- **Actionable Decisions**: Use the insights from top/bottom performers for portfolio rebalancing, strategic investments, or risk mitigation.
